## Task 0: Git and GitHub
<hr>
I have just started my "coding path" so it was the first encounter with 
Git and GitHub - a lot of new staff for me, but I am managing :).
Huge "Thanks!" to those people who set all those tasks up and systemized 
the learning material - and I mean it. Frankly, if I hadn't participated in 
the completion of the Udacity course I don't know how long it would have taken me
to realize how important version control is.
