## Task 0: Git and GitHub

I have just started my "coding path" so it was the first encounter with 
Git and GitHub - a lot of new staff for me, but I am managing :).
Huge "Thanks!" to those people who set all those tasks up and systemized 
the learning material - and I mean it. Frankly, if I hadn't participated in 
the completion of the Udacity course I don't know how long it would have taken me
to realize how important version control is.

## Task 1: Git and GitHub

I have never worked with the terminal before and I used to wonder – why would
you use it? After watching “Linux Command Line Basics” and “Configuring Linux Web Servers” 
I at least have a grasp why would you use Linux and how to work with shell commands 
in the terminal, but I feel like it’s a lot of learning waiting for me in the future :)
"Networking for Web Developers" is a great course the kind of I have been looking 
around for a while in order to understand how the Internet in general works. I hope 
I did get it, but it should definitely be re-watched.
